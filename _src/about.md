I'm a front-end web developer based in northern Vermont. I've always loved [working on the web](/work/) and try to build sites that are responsive, fast to load, and accessible to everyone.

Once upon a time I taught a 12-week web development course to individuals with no prior web experience. The program was a partnership between [Vermont HITEC](https://iaahitec.org/) and [Dealer.com](https://www.dealer.com/) to provide the technical skills and [hands-on training](https://www.vpr.org/post/vermont-hitec-training-program-guarantees-jobs#stream/0) needed to earn a full-time development job. We setup shop in an old cafe with _inconsistent_ heat and I developed the course materials on-the-fly. Against all odds the program was a complete success, with every individual graduating and receiveing a full-time job offer.

## Outside of Work

I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, taking photographs, and getting my hands dirty in our garden.
