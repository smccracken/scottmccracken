I've worked as a web developer since 2003 when I took my first post-college job with [Dealer.com](http://www.dealer.com). At the time they were a small company providing online solutions for car dealerships. Now they're a huge company providing online solutions for car dealerships. It was fun to be a part of that process.

Since 2010 I've worked full time for [CarComplaints.com](http://www.carcomplaints.com) â€“ an online resource aimed at helping car owners figure out what's wrong with their vehicle. 

I'm not a car guy and sometimes wonder how I ended up spending a career working on automotive websites.
