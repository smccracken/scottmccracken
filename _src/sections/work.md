When I took my first post-college job with [Dealer.com](http://www.dealer.com), they were a small company providing online solutions for car dealerships. Now they're a huge company providing online solutions for car dealerships. It was fun to be a part of that process.

After 7 years I left to work alongside a former colleague on [CarComplaints.com](http://www.carcomplaints.com) â€“ an online resource aimed at helping car owners figure out what's wrong with their vehicle. 

I'm not a car guy, but have somehow spent my [entire career](/resume/ "Scott McCracken's Resume") working on automotive websites. Go figure.
