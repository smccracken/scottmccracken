It's not exactly healthy to spend an entire day behind a computer screen. That's something I realized _far_ too late in my career.

Photography is an excellent excuse for getting outside. It's also brought me on a drive or hikes that I might have otherwise skipped.

Over the years I've [taken a lot of pictures](http://www.instagram.com/scottmccracken/). [Some I'm even proud of](http://scottmccracken.tumblr.com).
