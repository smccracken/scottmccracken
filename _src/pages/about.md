summary: I believe a strong foundation is the key to a successful, inclusive website. That means focusing on HTML semantics and not thinking about accessibility as a to-do list item, but as a core component of ever site.

## Working on the Web

My focus is building fast, accessible sites that work for everyone.

When I took my first post-college job with [Dealer.com](http://www.dealer.com), they were a small company providing online solutions for car dealerships. Now they're a huge company providing online solutions for car dealerships. It was fun to be a part of that process. After 7 years I left to work alongside a former colleague on [CarComplaints.com](http://www.carcomplaints.com) â€“ an online resource aimed at helping car owners figure out what's wrong with their vehicle.

I'm not a car guy, but have somehow spent my entire career working on automotive websites.

### Once upon a time I even taught web development

As part of a partnership between [Dealer.com](http://dealer.com) and [Vermont HITEC](http://www.vthitec.org/index.html), I taught a 12-week class on web development. The educational program was _designed to provide the academic knowledge, technical skills, and [hands-on training](https://www.vpr.org/post/vermont-hitec-training-program-guarantees-jobs#stream/0) needed to succeed in a specific career field_.

The course didn't exist when I was asked to lead it. There were many late nights spent writing the next day's curriculum and even more mornings questioning what the heck I was doing. We taught the whole thing in a vacant old cafe. Like _real_ professionals.

Something must have gone right because every student successfully completed the course and earned their job making the web a better place. It was the most challenging part of my career. It was also the most rewarding.

## I really love taking photos

It's not exactly healthy to spend an entire day behind a computer screen. That's something I realized _far_ too late in my career.

Photography is an excellent excuse for getting outside. It's also brought me on a drive or hikes that I might have otherwise skipped.

Over the years I've [taken a lot of pictures](http://www.instagram.com/scottmccracken/). [Some I'm even proud of](http://scottmccracken.tumblr.com).
