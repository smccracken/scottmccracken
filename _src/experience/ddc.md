Part of a team that managed templates used on thousands of websites across the country. The templates had to be responsive, flexible, and able to accept different themes. In partnership with [Vermont HITEC](http://www.vthitec.org/index.html) I helped train a team of web developers who also managed and created new templates,

I was also responsible for maintaining the front-end development of the [corporate website](http://www.dealer.com/). I worked with marketing, design, and development teams to create a cohesive look and integrate a video solution used to market products.
