"If a website is too much of an ordeal or time-consuming, then I've already clicked away." said Mike Adams who was born with a physical disability.

* An estimated Â£11.8bn ($13 billion USD) is lost every year as the result of "click-away" costs because sites aren't accessible.
* Mr. Adams is promoting [Purple Tuesday](https://purpletuesday.org.uk/), a day promoting accessibility awareness to businesses in the UK.
