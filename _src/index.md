lede: I've been working on websites for over 15 years. My first job was creating backup HTML versions of flash-only sites (kids, ask your parents) in case there was a problem with the plugin. It was an early introduction to how visuals are often prioritized over substance. It didn't take long for those backup sites to start outranking their flash counterparts. Since then I've wanted to focus on what makes the web great â€“ content, performance, and accessibility.
